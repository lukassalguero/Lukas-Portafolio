# Project 1: Analysis of the relationship between sociodemographic variables and hemoglobin levels in children aged 6 to 36 months in Peru.

This project analyzes a dataset provided by ENDES (Demographic and Family Health Survey) administered by INEI, consisting of 10,332 surveys, using R Studio, Python, the `Pandas` and `Matplotlib` libraries. The analysis aims to identify trends and generate visualizations that help make data-driven decisions.


## Introduction

Anemia is a public health problem in Peru. Among the most vulnerable people are children, especially those between 6 and 36 months of age, since they are in a critical stage of their development. Therefore, it is important to analyze the factors associated with anemia in this specific sector, since studying them will allow the implementation of strategies that allow reducing the levels of anemia in the child population.

## Objective

The general objective of this research is to analyze the relationship between sociodemographic variables and the hemoglobin level of children aged 6 to 36 months in Peru. In addition, a multiple regression model is sought to explain the hemoglobin level in children based on covariates that provide precision to the estimation of the model.

## Variables to be analyzed

- Altitude of place of residence (masl)
- Geographic region
- Wealth or well-being quintile

- Educational level completed by mother
- Mother's native language
- Sex of infant
- Age of infant in months
- Birth weight (g)
- Infant had fever in the last 2 weeks (Yes/No)
