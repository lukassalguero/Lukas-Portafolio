# Analysis of the relationship between sociodemographic variables and hemoglobin levels in children aged 6 to 36 months in Peru.

## Introduction

Anemia is a public health problem in Peru. Among the most vulnerable people are children, especially those between 6 and 36 months of age, since they are in a critical stage of their development. Therefore, it is important to analyze the factors associated with anemia in this specific sector, since its study will allow the implementation of strategies that allow reducing the levels of anemia in the child population.
In particular, the general objective of this research is to analyze the relationship of sociodemographic variables with the hemoglobin level of children between 6 and 36 months of age in Peru. In addition, it seeks to build a multiple regression model that explains the hemoglobin level in children based on the covariates that provide precision to the estimation of the model.

## Methods

# 2.1. Study design, population, and study sample

This study evaluated factors associated with the presence of childhood anemia, calculated from an altitude-corrected hemoglobin level of less than 11 mg/dl. Sociodemographic factors, maternal characteristics, and factors associated with maternal-child care were identified.
The population is children from 6 to 36 months of age in Peru who have successfully had their hemoglobin measured. For the study, the 10,332 ENDES surveys from 2018 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI) for the child sector specified above were taken as a sample.

# 2.2. Response variable and explanatory variables
The study presents 10 sociodemographic variables, of which 3 are quantitative and 7 qualitative. The quantitative variables are: age of the mother (years), age of the infant (months) and weight of the infant at birth (gr). The qualitative variables are: altitude of the place of residence (masl), geographic region, wealth or well-being quintile, educational level completed by the mother, mother's native language, sex of the infant and whether the infant had a fever in the last 2 weeks.
All variables were analyzed and the most relevant ones were presented, which specifically are wealth index, education of the mother and altitude of place of residence, which are qualitative ordinal. The response variable is the infant's hemoglobin level (mg/dl). This is a continuous quantitative variable.
